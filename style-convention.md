# Smasholic – Apple-Style UI Convention

## 1. Core Design Philosophy

Design must prioritize:
- Clarity over decoration
- Hierarchy over quantity
- Spacing over borders
- Subtlety over loudness

The interface must feel:
- Calm
- Intentional
- Precise
- Focused on one primary action per screen

---

## 2. Visual Hierarchy Rules

Only one element per screen can dominate attention.

If everything is highlighted, nothing is highlighted.

To create hierarchy:
- Reduce surrounding noise
- Use spacing before using color
- Use weight before using size
- Use size before using color

Primary attention = Card content (Game)
Secondary = Filter
Tertiary = Location

---

## 3. Color Discipline

Primary color (Burnt Orange) is for:
- Primary CTA
- Urgent states (e.g., few slots left)
- Active filter state

Primary color must NOT be used for:
- Section titles
- Decorative icons
- Body text

Text colors:
- Primary text: near-black
- Secondary text: 60–70% gray
- Disabled text: 40–50% gray

Less color = stronger impact.

---

## 4. Spacing System

Use an 8pt spacing system.

Standard spacing:
- 8pt: tight grouping
- 16pt: internal padding
- 24pt: section separation
- 32pt+: major layout separation

Never rely on borders to separate sections.
Use whitespace instead.

Whitespace creates premium perception.

---

## 5. Card Design Principles

Cards must:
- Float subtly from background
- Use soft shadow (not heavy)
- Have consistent corner radius
- Avoid thick borders

Shadow rules:
- Soft blur
- Low opacity
- Slight vertical offset

Cards should feel elevated, not floating aggressively.

---

## 6. Typography Rules

Typography hierarchy:
- Large title: reserved for primary content only
- Section titles: medium weight, neutral color
- Body text: regular weight
- Metadata (price, rating): smaller, lower contrast

Never use color to compensate for poor hierarchy.

Readable > Stylish.

---

## 7. Interaction Principles

Micro-interactions must be subtle:
- Slight scale animation on tap (95–98%)
- Smooth filter activation
- No aggressive motion

Motion must:
- Confirm intent
- Not distract
- Be fast and responsive

---

## 8. Minimalism Rule

Remove any element that:
- Does not support the primary action
- Does not add information
- Exists only for decoration

Ask for every element:
“Does this help the user decide faster?”

If not, remove it.

---

## 9. Focus Rule

Home screen = decision surface.

Do not:
- Add motivational text
- Add marketing copy
- Add unnecessary icons

The user opens Smasholic to find and join a game quickly.

Design must serve that.

---

## 10. Design Quality Test

A screen passes the “Apple Test” if:

1. The eye lands on the primary action within 2 seconds.
2. There is visible breathing space.
3. No element fights for attention.
4. Color is restrained and intentional.
5. The UI feels calm even with active content.

If the screen feels busy, reduce — do not add.

End of Convention.
